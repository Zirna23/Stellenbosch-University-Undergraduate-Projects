## ANSWER

The error message JWT Authentication Error: JsonWebTokenError: jwt malformed indicates that the JWT token being provided in the request is not correctly formatted. This can happen for several reasons, such as:

Missing Token: The token is not being sent in the request headers.
Incorrect Token Format: The token is not in the correct format (e.g., missing parts or invalid characters).
Malformed Token: The token is corrupted or tampered with.
Steps to Debug and Fix the Issue
Check the Request Headers:

Ensure that the Authorization header is being sent with the request and contains a valid JWT token.
The header should look like this: Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>.
Validate the Token Format:

Ensure that the token is a valid JWT, which typically consists of three parts separated by dots (e.g., header.payload.signature).
Update the authenticate Function:

Add checks to handle cases where the token is missing or malformed.

## QUESTION

Can you run a resolver inside another resolver?

## ANSWER

Yes, you can call one resolver from within another resolver in GraphQL. This can be useful for reusing logic or fetching related data. However, it's generally better to keep resolvers independent and modular to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.

## QUESTION

{ "errors": [ { "message": "null value in column "note_id" of relation "permissions" violates not-null constraint", "locations": [ { "line": 2, "column": 3 } ], "path": [ "createNote" ], "extensions": { "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR", "exception": { "stacktrace": [ "Error: null value in column "note_id" of relation "permissions" violates not-null constraint", " at Object.createNote (/Users/tasheelgovender/Desktop/Dev/3rd_year/343/group-28/my-note-app/my-note-app-backend/graphql/resolvers.js:147:15)", " at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)" ] } } } ], "data": { "createNote": null } }

## ANSWER

The error message indicates that the note_id value being inserted into the permissions table is null, which violates the not-null constraint. This suggests that the note.id is not being correctly retrieved or passed when creating the permission.

Please log in again.] { locations: undefined, path: undefined, extensions: { code: 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR', exception: { stacktrace: [Array] } } }

But when I hit the login mutation in my graphql resolvers strait from my graphql server ui it works?

## ANSWER

The error message TokenExpiredError: jwt expired indicates that the JWT token being used for authentication has expired. This can happen if the token's expiration time (expiresIn) is set too short or if an old token is being used.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Check Token Expiration Time: Ensure that the token expiration time set in your resolvers.js is appropriate. Currently, it is set to 1d (one day). If you need a longer session, you can increase this value.

;
Clear Old Tokens: Ensure that old tokens are not being used. When you log in, the new token should be stored in localStorage. Clear any old tokens from localStorage before storing the new one.

token
Check System Time: Ensure that the system time on both the server and client machines is correct. If the system time is incorrect, it can cause the token to appear expired.

Debugging: Add some debugging logs to check the token's expiration time and the current time when the token is being verified.

;
Token Refresh Mechanism: Implement a token refresh mechanism if you need to keep the user logged in for longer periods without requiring them to log in again. This typically involves issuing a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token.

If the issue persists, please provide more details about the authenticate middleware and how the token is being verified. This will help in providing a more specific solution.

## QUESTION

How do i get the expiration date of this token? if (token) { try { console.log("Current time:", new Date()); console.log

## ANSWER

To get the expiration date of a JWT token, you can decode the token and extract the exp (expiration) claim. Here's how you can do it using the jsonwebtoken library:

Install jsonwebtoken (if not already installed):
npm install jsonwebtoken

jsonwebtoken
Decode the token and log the expiration date:
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

if (token) {
try {
console.log("Current time:", new Date());

    // Decode the token without verifying the signature
    const decodedToken = jwt.decode(token);

    if (decodedToken && decodedToken.exp) {
      const expirationDate = new Date(decodedToken.exp * 1000); // Convert from seconds to milliseconds
      console.log("Token expiration time:", expirationDate);
    } else {
      console.log("Token does not have an expiration time.");
    }

} catch (err) {
console.error("Error decoding token:", err);
}
}
}
This code will log the current time and the expiration time of the token. The jwt.decode method decodes the token without verifying its signature, which is useful for extracting claims like exp.

## QUESTION

If my token has expired and I am logging in again, how can I resolve the issue of an expired token and prevent them from using an old token?

## ANSWER

To resolve the issue of an expired token and prevent users from using an old token when they log in again, you can follow these steps:

Invalidate the Old Token: Ensure that the old token is invalidated when the user logs in again. This can be done by removing the old token from the client-side storage (e.g., localStorage) before storing the new token.

Generate a New Token: When the user logs in, generate a new token and send it to the client.

Store the New Token: Store the new token in the client-side storage (e.g., localStorage).

Here is how you can implement these steps:

Backend: Generate a New Token on Login
Ensure that your login resolver generates a new token with an expiration date.
