## Projects Included

- Operating Systems Simulation
  Simulated CPU process scheduling and resource management using FCFS and Preemptive Priority algorithms.

- AI Game Agent (Gomoku with MPI)
  Implemented a parallel game-playing AI using the Minimax algorithm, distributed via MPI for concurrent evaluation.

- E-Spaza Full-Stack Web Platform 
  Group project: Developed a full-stack web application for managing inventory and placing orders across multiple spaza shops.  
  _Tech: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, TypeScript, HTML/CSS_

- SIMPL Compiler
  Built full compilers for the SIMPL language including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic checks, and code generation targeting the JVM via Jasmin.

- Image Compression with Automata
  Used automata theory to compress and decompress black-and-white images by mapping pixel addresses to finite automata representations.

- StackOverflow API Clone
  REST API project mimicking StackOverflow functionality using Flask and data scraped with BeautifulSoup.

- Data Structures & Algorithms 
  Coursework implementations of classic algorithms and data structures in C, Java, and Python.
